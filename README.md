T20 World Cup 2022 Best 11
Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of players in the T20 World Cup 2022 and select the best-performing 11 players for the team.

Dataset
The dataset used for analysis was obtained from Kaggle and comprised three sheets: a batting summary, a bowling summary, and a player's description. The data included various metrics such as runs scored, wickets taken, fielding statistics, and player descriptions. Data included match summary of all the 45 matches and statistics of over 240 players from 16 different participating nations.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset underwent thorough data cleaning and transformation processes. Using Python and Pandas, unwanted columns were removed, missing values were handled, and necessary changes in data types were made. Feature engineering techniques were also applied to derive new meaningful features from the existing data. After importing the cleaned dataset into Power BI, further data transformation was performed using Power Query to prepare it for analysis.

Parameter Building
To identify the top contenders for the playing 11, various performance parameters were created. These parameters involved analyzing batting averages, strike rates, bowling averages, economy rates, fielding efficiency, and overall player performance metrics. Weightage was assigned to each parameter based on its importance in cricket performance.

Data Analysis and Visualization
Data analysis and visualization techniques were employed to compare the shortlisted contenders and make informed decisions. Bar charts were used to visualize runs scored and wickets taken by each player. Funnel charts were used to track player performance across matches. Gauge charts were used to represent batting strike rates and bowling economy rates. Scatter plots were used to analyze fielding statistics such as catches and run-outs. Other visualization methods such as heatmaps and trend lines were also utilized to gain insights into the players' performances.

Conclusion
Based on the insights derived from the analysis and visualization, the best-performing 11 players for the T20 World Cup 2022 were determined. The final selection took into account the available data, the established performance parameters, and the strategic requirements of a T20 cricket team.
